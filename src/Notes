In React navigation, we have three types of navigators.
 
1)  Stack Navigator => Takes the user from one screen to another. It's very similar 
    to navigation built to web browser so we can push or pop screens from the stack.

2) Tab Navigator => For implementing the tab.
3) Drawer Navigator => For implementing the drawer.


Each navigator is implemented in a seperate library.
